You should never edit an installed package. Instead, install a forked version of package.

If you need to edit the code frequently, DO NOT install the package via pip install something and edit the code in '.../site_packages/...'

Instead, put the source code under a development directory, and install it with

python setup.py develop
# or
pip install -e path/to/SomePackage
# Or use a vcs at the first place
$ pip install -e git+https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde.git#egg=hyde
